Introduction
============
This quickstart demonstrates the usage of a rules service which performs an age check.
The input is the incoming message content (an "Applicant").
The output is a boolean, and mapped using the implicit "globals" Map.

This rules-interview-container quickstart differs from the rules-interview quickstart.
A /META-INF/kmodule.xml is used, which is referenced by both the <container> element in switchyard.xml, and the KIE/Drools container.
The rules-interview quickstart, on the other hand, manually lists the required resource.

This quickstart also demonstrates how a domain property can be made available as a global variable inside your DRL.
See references to ${user.name} (system property) mapping to userName (domain property) mapping to userName (global variable) inside switchyard.xml.
Then look at Interview.drl and how the userName global variable is used in the DRL.

This quickstart can be executed using either a java interface or a web service interface.

Preqrequisites 
==============
Maven

Running the quickstart
======================


EAP
----------
If installers have been previously installed on EAP skips the steps 1-4

1.  Download Jboss EAP 6.4 or upper


2.  Install them over your EAP instance:

           java -jar fuse-eap-installer.jar ${eap.home}

3.  Install the kie eap installer:

        java -jar kie-eap-installer.jar ${eap.home}

4.  Install the fuse-integration installer:

        java -jar fuse-integration-eap-installer-${version.fuse.bxms-integration}.jar ${eap.home}

5. Start EAP in standalone mode:

        ${AS}/bin/standalone.sh

6. Build and deploy the quickstart: 

        mvn install -Pdeploy

7. Submit a webservice request to invoke the SOAP gateway.  There are a number of ways to do this :
    - Submit a request with your preferred SOAP client - src/test/resources/xml contains 
      sample requests and the responses that you should see
    - Use the simple bundled SOAP client and the sample request XML e.g.
<br/>
```
        mvn exec:java
```
<br/>
    - SOAP-UI : Use the wsdl for this project (src/main/resources/wsdl/OrderService.wsdl) to 
      create a soap-ui project. Use the sample request (src/test/resources/xml/soap-request-pass.xml) 
      as an example of a sample request.  See the "Expected Output" section for the expected result. 

8. Undeploy the quickstart:

        mvn clean -Pdeploy


FUSE
----------
1. Start FUSE:

${FUSE_HOME}/bin/karaf


2. Ensure that the drools and switchyard compatible features URL files have been added to your Fuse instance. 
   In case they are not added then:

    features:addurl mvn:org.drools/drools-karaf-features/${version.org.kie}/xml/${drools.karaf.features.classifier}

3. Add the features URL for the respective version of BXMS.

JBossFuse:karaf@root> features:addurl mvn:org.jboss.integration.fuse.quickstarts/karaf-features/${project.version}/xml/features


4. Install the feature for the Rules Interview Container quickstart :

JBossFuse:karaf@root> features:install fuse-bxms-quickstart-switchyard-rules-interview-container

5. To submit a webservice request to invoke the SOAP gateway, run the quickstart client :
<br/>
```
mvn exec:java -Pkaraf
```
<br/>

6. Undeploy the quickstart:

JBossFuse:karaf@root> features:uninstall fuse-bxms-quickstart-switchyard-rules-interview-container


KARAF
----------
1. Start the Karaf server :

${KARAF_HOME}/bin/karaf


2. Ensure that the drools and switchyard compatible features URL files have been added to your Karaf instance. 
   In case they are not added then:

    features:addurl mvn:org.switchyard.karaf/switchyard/${version.switchyard}/xml/features
    features:addurl mvn:org.drools/drools-karaf-features/${version.org.kie}/xml/${drools.karaf.features.classifier}

3. Add the features URL for the respective version of BXMS.

karaf@root> features:addurl mvn:org.jboss.integration.fuse.quickstarts/karaf-features/${project.version}/xml/features


4. Install the feature for the Rules Interview Container quickstart :

karaf@root> features:install fuse-bxms-quickstart-switchyard-rules-interview-container

5. To submit a webservice request to invoke the SOAP gateway, run the quickstart client :
<br/>
```
mvn exec:java -Pkaraf
```
<br/>

6. Undeploy the quickstart:

karaf@root> features:uninstall fuse-bxms-quickstart-switchyard-rules-interview-container
